        - (signed integer) distance traversed (set to -1 if no measurement is available)
        - (signed integer) average heart rate (set to -1 if no measurement is available)
        - (signed integer) maximum heart rate (set to -1 if no measurement is available)
        - (signed integer) minimum heart rate (set to -1 if no measurement is available)
        - (unsigned integer) duration of the activity (in seconds)
